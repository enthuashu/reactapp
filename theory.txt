After successful creation of react app, we get a basic tempplate already developed react app.

To Start react app, we do "npm start" in terminal of Frontend folder.
React always runs at Port 3000 cannot be changed. Not like backend port where we can define any port.
that is why, we recommend not to use 3000 port, on backend server.

After React app is created, there are many unnecessary files which are of no or less use, so we can delete them for our comfort
Three important files must be there, i.e. App.js,index.js,any one css file

As we know, React uses only one html file. Now, index.js file is used to edit the html file by adding various components
In simpler words, we customize Html file, with the help of javascript


const express = require('express') // this import method is used in backend
import express from "express"
// but if you want to import anything from frontend, syntax changes
module.exports = App; // backend
export default App; // frontend

Our React app consists of a Main Parent component, called App.js. 

Component is basically a function which returns html.
Components are always imported with capital letter

Make a react app, which contains 5 components,
1=> Navbar
2=> Center component
3=> List component which shows list of 5 fruites
4=> A form component which takes 3 inputs, name,email,password
5=> footer component

Ps: You can use bootstrap
