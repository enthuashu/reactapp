To Start react app, we do "npm start" in terminal of Frontend folder.
React always runs at Port 3000 cannot be changed. Not like backend port where we can define any port.
that is why, we recommend not to use 3000 port, on backend server.

After React app is created, there are many unnecessary files which are of no or less use, so we can delete them for our comfort
Three important files must be there, i.e. App.js,index.js,any one css file

As we know, React uses only one html file. Now, index.js file is used to edit the html file by adding various components
In simpler words, we customize Html file, with the help of javascript
